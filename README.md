# WebStudio
<p>A website of a company that provides web development services. </p>
<p>It is an excellent example of semantic responsive markup. </p>
<p>HTML elements are used according to their specification, which has a positive effect on the site's SEO. </p>
<p>On very small screens (with a screen width of up to 480px), the site has a "rubber" layout that "stretches" depending on the screen width.</p>
<p>If the screen width is larger than 480 pixels, adaptive website layout is used, i.e. elements have one size for tablets and another for desktop devices. </p>
<p>The site also supports devices with high pixel density. Images will not lose quality for screens with 2x pixel density (for example, screens with Apple's Retina technology). </p>
